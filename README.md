# React CSR

Letâ€™s create a React app with client-side rendering (CSR) from scratch.

Prerequisites -

- Knowledge of React - because we are building a React app
- Knowledge of Javascript - because react is a javascript library
- Knowledge of Webpack - because the app needs to be served on the client side, and all the js file needs to be bundled so that they can be run in all browser

Let's start by cloning the project using

```
  git clone https://github.com/Charlygraphy23/react_client_csr

```

After that run `npm i` and start the development server `npm run start:dev`.

After the successful run you will see this in your terminal

If we see our browser at `http://localhost:3000` we should be able see this -

here an empty index.html file has been fetched with a bundle.js. `createRoot` will render the bundle.js file inside this

```html
<div id="root"></div>
```
